# LUISS X NTT-Data-Business-Game
<p> This report refers to the business problem presented by NTT Data. The business problem consists on purposing a business opportunity for an e-commerce company operating in the Spanish market. The analysis proceeds with the identification and development of the the model that defines the best solution to be presented to the customer. 
The main goal was to increase profitability through a customer analysis that aimed at identifying groups of users with similar purchasing behaviours in order to create a marketing strategy towards each target. We then proceed with the creation of a recommendation system able to provide to each user a set of products related to their interests, in order to maximise the probability of purchase. Finally we carried out a shipping time analysis to predict an accurate date of delivery and to reduce delays, in order to improve the quality of the shipping service. 
In the following paragraphs, we explain how we achieved each of our goals.

### Data
<p> 8 datasets in csv form 
  
 ### Modelling approach 
 <p> For the three tasks repectively we used the K-means clustering and an empirical method (RFM matrix), open-source pyhton library Suprise for the recommendation system and different algorthims (Lasso, Ridge, KNN, Random Forrest, Extra Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and XGBoost) for the time shipping analysis.
